## Introduction

This is a training module for using unix in the form of jupyter notebooks. Begin in the [index](unix-training-notebooks/index.ipynb) notebook and this will guide you through the training.

Key aims of the training include:

- Understanding why UNIX is sutable for analysing NGS data
- Knowing what the UNIX command line is
- Understanding the UNIX directory structure and navigate around this structure
- Being able to manipulate (move, copy and delete ) files using the command line
- Looking at and sorting the contents of a file
- Finding the unique items in a list

## Known issues

The `man` command is not currently supported on Jupyterhub. If you need any additional information on a command we suggest to try `man <command>` on the farm instead.
